		<p>Welcome to this site. It's a place where people can talk about video games all they want.</p>

		<p>Super Smash Bros. is a video game seires that started in 1999 on the Nintendo 64. The first game had 12 characters that included Mario, 
		Donkey Kong, Link, Samus, Kirby, Yoshi, Fox, Pikachu, Luigi, Jigglypuff, Ness and Captian Falcon. It's a Nintendo All star game where 
		characters take part in fighting macthes unlike that of other fighting games. The game was directed by Mashiro Sakurai, and the game 
		started in development as "Dragon King: The Fighting Game", and it featured original characters rather than Nintendo's famous characters. 
		He wanted to star Nintendo's IPs because they were well known, and the original characters all had simillar moveset. Sakurai thought 
		that this is only apporiate only for an arcade, as two friends will just stop by and have a simple macth and leave, not so for a home 
		console. So he made a demo in secret, having Mario, Donkey Kong, Samus and Fox. When he showed it to his boss, Satoru Iwata, 
		he aceptted it, and the first Smash Bros. came into being.</p>

		<p> In the thrid game of the series, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a story based campaign is introduced, known as the Subspace Emissary. 
		It's setting is in a world where characters fight each other until one gets turned into a trophy. Once that happens they can 
		only be revived when anohter character touches the trophie's base and they get turned back. However their world is soon invaded 
		by unknown forces form the outside, who aptempt to cover the world in darkness and take it over for themsevles, in turn turning every 
		charater into a trophy permently. So then they have to fight back agaisnt this before it is too late.</p>
